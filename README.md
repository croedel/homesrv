# awidoAPI

## Introduction
This project `ninaAPI` offers a (hopefully) user-friendly API to the NINA API https://nina.api.bund.dev/ and allows you to retrieve warning messages for your home location.

I hope you like the project and it helps you to realize your use-case!

## How to use the API
You can find some demo code in `demo.py`.
